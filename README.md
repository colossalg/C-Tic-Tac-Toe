TicTacToe
=========
This program implements the game of TicTacToe and a basic AI agent to play
against. The agent uses the negamax search algorithm to determine the best
move. This agent is a basic implementation that does not save state between
searches or check for duplicate nodes in the search tree; it searches the
entire tree to the leaf nodes naiively.
